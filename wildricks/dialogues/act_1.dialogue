		Aurum: Ah, good evening! I hope you slept well. Must have been a long journey.
		Aurum: I was just about to make dinner. Why don’t you go out and explore a bit, hm?
		Aurum: While you’re out there, would you mind grabbing me some fresh fruit? Strawberries, coconut, and mango, to be precise.
		Aurum: My good friend Evalie runs a fruit stall in the plaza. Here, this should be enough.

		System: (Aurum gave you 5000 shells!)

	Aurum: What’s on your mind?
	- There are Kids… missing?
		Aurum: Oh, those silly kids? They’re the heart of the town, really.
		Aurum: Without them, life on this island would be nothing, indeed.
		=> END
	- Do you get a lot of visitors around here
		Aurum: Not too many.
		Aurum: Usually, the only people who come to this island have…
		Aurum: … well, some kind of important reason for it, you could say.
		Aurum: Whether that’s an escape or something else.

	- Spirits?
		Aurum: Don’t worry. There aren’t any spirits in this area.

## (Plaza, entering for the first time. Few NPCs on the way to Evalie’s stall).
# TODO: set this to default Jai dialogue
Jai: I can’t remember the last time I went outside without getting absolutely soaked…
Jai: The wrath of the spirits is truly a force to be reckoned with.
=> END


~ Theo
# TODO: set this to default Theo dialogue Theo: Sometimes, I wish I would just drown in the ocean already.
Theo: Death can’t be worse than eternal grey skies, can it?
Theo: I suppose that is the power of the spirits, at their worst.

~ Hannah
# TODO: set this to default Hannah dialogue
Hannah: You can check out any time you like,
But you can never leave!
=> END


~ Olivia
# TODO: set this to default Olivia dialogue
Olivia: Despite not being a mother yet, I already feel like one.
Olivia: I can’t tell whether I’m over-worrying or not…
Olivia: I suppose it’s a blessing no one’s gonna laugh at me. No, more like a curse…

## BEGIN CUTSCENE
Evalie: Thanks. Give Aurum my regards.
Evalie: …
Evalie: Oh, I almost forgot!
Evalie: I think Aurum stole Julian’s rice cooker at our potluck the other day. I’m sure Julian will be the grateful if you nab it for him.
Evalie: Julian’s right at the end of this road--

Peasprout: Everyone! Come quickly! Our kids have gone missi--!
Peasprout: Sarah, why isn’t this microphone working?! Fix it, damn it!
Sarah: Uh, Mrs. Peasprout--
# TODO: play microphone glitch audio
Peasprout: (SUPER LOUD VOICE BYTES)
Peasprout: Ah, there we go.

Furl: Sinners are sinners, Peasprout.
Peasprout: Look at what they have done! Do you even think they care about us, at this point?
Peasprout: But then, Aurum, you haven’t lost any family from these storms, I wouldn’t expect you to understand.
Aurum: …
Sarah: Enough!  
Sarah: Everyone must return to their houses. 
Sarah: Now. We’ll send search parties in the morning.
Peasprout: They’re just kids. I… We… We should have done something.
Theo: What w
Sarah: Theo…

~ Aurum_2
Aurum: Welcome back! Admittedly, there isn’t much to see at the moment.
Aurum: Normally, around this time of the year, all the tropical flowers start blooming. It’s a gorgeous sight. Perhaps they’ll be back next year.
Aurum: Anyway, here’s dinner. Some ___. Be sure to take a nice bath, lest you want to freeze your gills all night.
Protag: # TODO: add dialogue here
Aurum: Ah… yes.
Aurum: There’s been a bit of a war going on, I suppose it’s fair to say, things haven’t been the greatest around here, as of late. 
Aurum: Sinners everywhere, making all that jazz with the spirits…
Aurum: Well, no need to worry about that. Enjoy your vacation!
